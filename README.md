This Python script analyzes data about people, using Pandas.

It creates a DataFrame from a dictionary containing names, ages, city locations, and assigns a gender category to each person (assuming this data is known).
The script then performs various operations on the DataFrame, including:
Printing the entire DataFrame, a specific column ('Name'), and filtered data (people older than 25).
Generating descriptive statistics for the 'Age' column (measures like mean, standard deviation etc.).
Adding a new column 'Gender' with assigned values.
Grouping data by gender and calculating the average age for each group.
Sorting the DataFrame by age in descending order.
Finally, the script saves the DataFrame to a CSV file named 'output.csv'
